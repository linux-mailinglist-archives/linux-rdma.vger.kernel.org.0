One of the immediate usages of this DM that come to my mind is very
fast spinlocks for MPI applications. In such case, the amount of DM
will be property of network topology in given MPI cluster.

In this scenario, precise amount of memory will ensure that all jobs
will continue to give maximal performance despite any programmer's
error in DM allocation.

For under provisioning scenario and if application is written correctly,
users will experience more latency and less performance, due to the PCI
accesses.

Slide 3 in Liran's presentation gives brief overview about motivation.
