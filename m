Right, given existence of NFSoRDMA over IB makes it so that DRC
implementation for the RDMA transport should be on something else than
ports and IPs.  (or we should restrict NFSoRDMA to 4.1+ :-))

If that port stayed the same (which it's not), why wouldn't it be
sufficient for DRC? It would be exactly the same as if proto=udp.

What I see printed here isn't not what I see in the network trace in
wireshark for the UDP port. It's also confusing that
Connection manager communication (in my case) say between source port
55410 (which stays the same on remounts) and dst port 4791. Then NFS
traffic is between source port 63494 (which changes on remounts) and
destination port 4791. Yet, NFS reports that source port was 40403 and
destination port was 20049(!).

The code that I looked at (as you pointed) was for the connection
manager and that port stays constant but for the NFSoRDMA after that
it's from a new port that changes all the time (even for the Mellanox
card).

Looks like there is no way to get the "real" port thru the rdma layers
on either side.
