Just realized, isn't that example actually a true positive, or at least 
a great candidate for a true positive, since if another thread reenters 
that signaling path, it will block on that mutex, and the fence would 
never be signaled unless there is another signaling path?

Although I agree the conclusion is sound: These annotations cannot be 
sprinkled mindlessly over the code.
