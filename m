Yes, I think the first two can be merged without causing any pain. Feel 
free to add my ab on them.

And the third one can go in immediately as well.

Thanks,

>>> + * * Due to how many other subsystems are involved and the locking hierarchies

>>> + *   dma_resv_unlock(). On the other side it also interacts through all
>>> + *   allocation sites through &mmu_notifier and &shrinker.
>>> + *
>>> + * Furthermore lockdep does not handle cross-release dependencies, which means
>>> + * any deadlocks between dma_fence_wait() and dma_fence_signal() can't be caught
>>> + * at runtime with some quick testing. The simplest example is one thread
>>> + * waiting on a &dma_fence while holding a lock::
>>> + *
>>> + *     lock(A);
>>> + *     dma_fence_wait(B);
>>> + *     unlock(A);
>>> + *
>>> + * while the other thread is stuck trying to acquire the same lock, which
>>> + * prevents it from signalling the fence the previous thread is stuck waiting
>>> + * on::
>>> + *
>>> + *     lock(A);
>>> + *     unlock(A);
>>> + *     dma_fence_signal(B);
>>> + *
>>> + * By manually annotating all code relevant to signalling a &dma_fence we can
>>> + * teach lockdep about these dependencies, which also helps with the validation
>>> + * headache since now lockdep can check all the rules for us::
>>> + *
>>> + *    cookie = dma_fence_begin_signalling();
>>> + *    lock(A);
>>> + *    unlock(A);
>>> + *    dma_fence_signal(B);
>>> + *    dma_fence_end_signalling(cookie);
>>> + *
>>> + * For using dma_fence_begin_signalling() and dma_fence_end_signalling() to
>>> + * annotate critical sections the following rules need to be observed:
>>> + *
>>> + * * All code necessary to complete a &dma_fence must be annotated, from the
>>> + *   point where a fence is accessible to other threads, to the point where
>>> + *   dma_fence_signal() is called. Un-annotated code can contain deadlock issues,
>>> + *   and due to the very strict rules and many corner cases it is infeasible to
>>> + *   catch these just with review or normal stress testing.
>>> + *
>>> + * * &struct dma_resv deserves a special note, since the readers are only
>>> + *   protected by rcu. This means the signalling critical section starts as soon
>>> + *   as the new fences are installed, even before dma_resv_unlock() is called.
>>> + *
>>> + * * The only exception are fast paths and opportunistic signalling code, which
>>> + *   calls dma_fence_signal() purely as an optimization, but is not required to
>>> + *   guarantee completion of a &dma_fence. The usual example is a wait IOCTL
>>> + *   which calls dma_fence_signal(), while the mandatory completion path goes
>>> + *   through a hardware interrupt and possible job completion worker.
>>> + *
>>> + * * To aid composability of code, the annotations can be freely nested, as long
>>> + *   as the overall locking hierarchy is consistent. The annotations also work
>>> + *   both in interrupt and process context. Due to implementation details this
>>> + *   requires that callers pass an opaque cookie from
>>> + *   dma_fence_begin_signalling() to dma_fence_end_signalling().
>>> + *
>>> + * * Validation against the cross driver contract is implemented by priming
>>> + *   lockdep with the relevant hierarchy at boot-up. This means even just
>>> + *   testing with a single device is enough to validate a driver, at least as
>>> + *   far as deadlocks with dma_fence_wait() against dma_fence_signal() are
>>> + *   concerned.
