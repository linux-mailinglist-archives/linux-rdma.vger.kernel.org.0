Yeah, I'm not sure if tcpdump can snoop on the IB traffic. I know that
upstream tcpdump can snoop on RDMA mellanox card (but I only know
about the Roce mode).

I'm having a hard time reproducing the problem. But I only tried
"xfs", "btrfs", "ext4" (first two send a CLONE since the file system
supports it), the last one exercises a copy. In all my tries your
xfs_io commands succeed. The differences between our environments are
(1) ZFS vs (xfs, etc) and (2) IB vs RoCE. Question is: does any
copy_file_range work over RDMA/IB. One thing to try a synchronous
copy: create a small file 10bytes and do a copy. Is this the case
where we have copy and the callback racing, so instead do a really
large copy: create a >=1GB file and do a copy. that will be an async
copy but will not have a racy condition. Can you try those 2 examples
for me?

Not sure how useful tracepoints here are. The results of the COPY
isn't interesting as this is an async copy. The server should have
sent a CB_COMPOUND with the copy's results. The process stack tells me
that COPY is waiting for the results (waiting for the callback). So
the question is there a problem of sending a callback over RDMA/IB? Or
did the client receive it and missed it somehow? We really do need
some better tracepoints in the copy (but we don't have them
currently).

Would you be willing to install the upstream libpcap/tcpdump to see if
it can capture RDMA/IB traffic or perhaps Chunk knows that it doesn't
work for sure?

Thank you.
