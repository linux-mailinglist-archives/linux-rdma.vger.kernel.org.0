Good point. We aren't using the fmr_pools.

There are couple of layers but you can see the FRWR code inside,
net/rds/ib_frmr.c. The MR allocation as well as free/invalidation
is managed from user-land instead of ULP data path. There are
couple of cases where some use_once semantics does MR invalidation
within kernel but thats only because userland indicated that MR
key can be invalidated after issued RDMA ops is complete.

That will surely help if its an option. RDS don't use fmr_pools so no
issues there.
