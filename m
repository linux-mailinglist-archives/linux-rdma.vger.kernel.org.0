 Well, in principle in a setup with reliable links the LBMS bit may never 
be set, e.g. this system of mine has been in 24/7 operation since the last 
reboot 410 days ago and for the devices that support Link Active reporting 
it shows:

LnkSta:Speed 2.5GT/s, Width x1, TrErr- Train- SlotClk- DLActive+ BWMgmt- ABWMgmt-
LnkSta:Speed 5GT/s, Width x8, TrErr- Train- SlotClk- DLActive+ BWMgmt+ ABWMgmt+
LnkSta:Speed 5GT/s, Width x1, TrErr- Train- SlotClk- DLActive+ BWMgmt- ABWMgmt+

LnkSta:Speed 2.5GT/s, Width x1, TrErr- Train- SlotClk- DLActive+ BWMgmt- ABWMgmt-

so out of 11 devices 6 have the LBMS bit clear.  But then 5 have it set, 
perhaps worryingly, so of course you're right, that it will get set in the 
field, though it's not enough by itself for your problem to trigger.

 Then there is manual link retraining, which we do from time to time as 
well, which will set the bit too, which I overlooked.

 To cut the story short, it was an oversight of mine, especially as I 
don't really make any use myself of hot plug scenarios.

 It's a complex matter.  For a starter please read the introduction at 
`pcie_failed_link_retrain'.

 When the problem triggers the link goes into an infinite link training 
loop, with the Link Training (LT) bit flipping on and off.  I've made a 
complementary workaround for U-Boot (since your bootstrap device can be 
downstream such a broken link), where a statistical probe is done for the 
LT bit flipping as discovered by polling the bit in a tight loop.  This is 
fine for a piece of firmware that has nothing better to do, but in an OS 
kernel we just can't do it.

 Also U-Boot does not remove the 2.5GT/s clamp because it does not have to 
set up the system in an optimal way, but just sufficiently to successfully 
boot.  An OS kernel can then adjust the configuration if it knows about 
the workaround, or leave it as it is.  In the latter case things will 
continue working across PCIe resets, because the TLS field is sticky.

 For Linux I went for just checking the DLLLA bit as it seems good enough 
for devices that support Link Active reporting.  And I admit that the 
workaround is quite aggressive, but this was a deliberate decision 
following the robustness principle: the end user may not be qualified 
enough to diagnose the problem and given its nature not even think it's 
something that can be made to work.  The downstream device does not show 
up in the PCIe hierarchy and just looks like it's broken.  It takes a lot 
of knowledge and experience to notice the LT bit flipping and even myself, 
quite a seasoned Linux kernel developer, only noticed it by chance.

 It was discussed to death with the original submission, the rationale is 
given in the introductory comment and I'd prefer that it stays as it is.  
The ASM2824 switch works just fine with other downstream devices and so 
does the PI7C9X2G304 switch with other upstream devices.  Both vendors 
refused to help narrow it down and declined to comment (a person from 
Diodes n√©e Pericom replied, but they learnt it's about a PCIe switch they 
told me they were from another department and couldn't help), which would 
have helped (I now just recommend staying away from both manufacturers).  
Therefore my assumption is this can potentially trigger with any pair of 
devices.

 I have now posted a patch series to address this problem of yours and a 
previous issue reported by Ilpo.  See: 
<https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-pci/list/?series=878216>, and 
I've included you in the list of direct recipients too.

 I will appreciate if you give it a try, and again, apologies for the 
trouble caused, but such things happen in engineering.
