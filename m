The new API seems fit pretty good to our purpose, better than scatter-gather dma-mapping. So we want to continue work with you to adopt this new API.

I ask because we are seeing some issues but not sure whether it is caused by the new API. We are debugging but it would be good to also ask at the same time.

Hi, Zeng

I have tested this patch series. And a patch about NVMe will cause some 
call trace. But if you revert this patch about NVMe, the whole patches 
can work well. You can develop your patches based on this patch series.

It seems that "some agreements can not be reached" about NVMe. So NVMe 
patch can not work well. I do not delve into this NVMe patch.
