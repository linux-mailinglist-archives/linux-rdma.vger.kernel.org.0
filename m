Ok will do that. Do you have access to the RH case on this one?

What is the point of the route_prot and addr_prot then?

Well whats the point to debug this if its only doing address resolution
via multicast and not via the SA?

Is there a particular issue with usiing the SA? The route information may
contain process specific information?
