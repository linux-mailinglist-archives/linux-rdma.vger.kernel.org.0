We'll need to clean that mess up anyway, and I've been chugging
along doing some of that.  A lot still assume no highmem, so we need
to convert them over to something that kmaps anyway.  If we get
the abstraction right that will actually help converting over to
a better reprsentation.

The assumes the request all has the same memory, which is a simplifing
assuption.  My idea was that if had our new bio_vec like this:

struct bio_vec {
	phys_addr_t		paddr; // 64-bit on 64-bit systems
	unsigned long		len;
};

we have a hole behind len where we could store flag.  Preferably
optionally based on a P2P or other magic memory types config
option so that 32-bit systems with 32-bit phys_addr_t actually
benefit from the smaller and better packing structure.

Ð†t sounds workable.  To some of the first steps are cleanups independent
of how the bio_vec is eventually going to look like.  That is making
the DMA-API internals work on the phys_addr_t, which also unifies the
map_resource implementation with map_page.  I plan to do that relatively
soon.  The next is sorting out access to bios data by virtual address.
All these need nice kmapping helper that avoid too much open coding.
I was going to look into that next, mostly to kill the block layer
bounce buffering code.  Similar things will also be needed at the
scatterlist level I think.  After that we need to more audits of
how bv_page is still used.  something like a bv_phys() helper that
does "page_to_phys(bv->bv_page) + bv->bv_offset" might come in handy
for example.
