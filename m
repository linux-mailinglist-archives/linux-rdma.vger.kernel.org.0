I'm curious how this theoretical 'deprecated' value would work
in context of uAPI which can never regress..

Looks like this paragraph had a line starting with #, presumably
talking about the ELF note and it got eaten by git? Please fix.


FWIW to me this series has a strong whiff of "we have an OOT module
which has much more functionality and want to support a degraded /
upstream-only mode in the user space stack". I'm probably over-
-interpreting, and you could argue this will help you make real
use of the upstream RDS. I OTOH would argue that it's a technical
solution to a non-technical problem of not giving upstreaming 
sufficient priority; I'd prefer to see code flowing upstream _first_ 
and then worry about compatibility.

IOW applying this patch is a bit of a leap of faith that RDS
upstreaming will restart. I don't have anything against the patch
per se, but neither do I have much faith in this. So if v5 is taking 
a long time to get applied it will be because its waiting for DaveM or
Paolo to take it.
