Even when devices are not limited they often perform significantly better
when IOVA space is not completely fragmented.  While the dma_map_sg code
is a bit gross due to the fact that it has to deal with unaligned segments,
the coalescing itself often is a big win.

Note that dma_map_sg also has two other very useful features:  batching
of the iotlb flushing, and support for P2P, which to be efficient also
requires batching the lookups.

You don't get sent to jail.  But you do not get batched iotlb sync, you
don't get properly working P2P, and you don't get IOVA coalescing.

Yeah, I don't really get the struct page argument.  In fact if we look
at the nitty-gritty details of dma_map_page it doesn't really need a
page at all.  I've been looking at cleaning some of this up and providing
a dma_map_phys/paddr which would be quite handy in a few places.  Note
because we don't have a struct page for the memory, but because converting
to/from it all the time is not very efficient.

AFAIK that does isn't really vfio as we know it but the control device
for live migration.  But Leon or Jason might fill in more.

The point is that quite a few devices have these page list based APIs
(RDMA where mlx5 comes from, NVMe with PRPs, AHCI, GPUs).

Because we only need to preallocate the tiny constant sized dma_iova_state
as part of the request instead of an additional scatterlist that requires
sizeof(struct page *) + sizeof(dma_addr_t) + 3 * sizeof(unsigned int)
per segment, including a memory allocation per I/O for that.

At least for the block code we have a nice little core wrapper that is
very easy to use, and provides a great reduction of memory use and
allocations.  The HMM use case I'll let others talk about.
