FWIW, dma_map_resource() *is* for P2P in general. The classic case of 
one device poking at another's registers that was the original 
motivation is a standalone DMA engine reading/writing a peripheral 
device's FIFO, so the very similar inter-device doorbell signal is 
absolutely in scope too; VRAM might be a slightly greyer area, but if 
it's still not page-backed kernel memory then I reckon that's fair game.

The only trouble is that it's not geared for *PCI* P2P when that may or 
may not happen entirely upstream of IOMMU translation.

Robin.
