Hi Jason,

Thank for your suggestions.

But I'm confuse about the relationship between "PCI ATOMIC" in this macro
and atomic operations in RDMA.

I found the related series on patchwork:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/10782873/

And I found the description about atomic operations in PCIe specification
v4.0:

"An Atomic Operation (AtomicOp) is a single PCI Express transaction that
targets a location in Memory Space, reads the locationâ€™s value, potentially
writes a new value back to the location, and returns the original value. This
"read-modify-write" sequence to the location is performed atomically."

It seems that the atomic for PCIe and RDMA is different concepts, and the macro
IBV_PCI_ATOMIC_OPERATION_4_BYTE_SIZE_SUP is for PCIe atomic.

Could you please give me more suggestions about them?

Thanks
Weihang
