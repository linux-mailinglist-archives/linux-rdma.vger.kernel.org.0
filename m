Generanlly the no-pandoc build is only for some old OS's. Most new
OS's should be installing pandoc and avoiding this flow.

But the scheme is to store the *output* of pandoc under the content
hash of the input.

So hashing the wrong input means you get the wrong output.

The hash *must* be the exact input to pandoc and rst2man.

The shift is essential, if we retain @CMAKE_FOO@ through to the nroff
then we could do substititon on the nroff output and everything would
work sensibly.

This seems a bit hard, but is the right way to make this work.

Alternatively for your use case it might be more reasonable to copy
the pandoc prebuilt files from a system with pandoc, that did a build
with your desired path, onto your system without.
