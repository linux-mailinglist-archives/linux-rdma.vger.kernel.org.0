PCI Atomics are optonal and are a much more recent facility.

RDMA Atomics do not require PCI Atomics, because they have
different semantics with respect to memory atomicity. Read
carefully and you'll see that they operate atomically only
within the adapter, and are not atomic all the way to the
underlying memory. It's a long and somewhat historical story.

Now that PCIe Atomics are becoming more widely supported by
processor complexes, there is the possibility these may be
more tightly embraced by RDMA implementations. There is
discussion in IBTA and IETF around this currently, in fact,
for the new RDMA Atomic Write operation.

Be aware that PCI Atomics are relatively expensive operations.
The existing ones perform a read-modify-write cycle on both
PCI and memory busses. This overhead is not to be taken lightly.
