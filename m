Afaik he strongly dislikes them when a Link: tag just points to the
submission of the patch being applied; at the same time he *really
wants* those links if they tell the backstory how a fix came into being,
which definitely includes the report about the issue being fixed (side
note: without those links regression tracking becomes so hard that it's
basically no feasible).

If my knowledge is not up to date, please if you have a minute do me a
favor and point me to Linus statement your refer to.

That was a change by somebody else, but FWIW, just use Closes: (instead
of Link:) with a link to the report on lore, that tag is not reserved
for bugs.

/me will go and update his boilerplate text used above

yw, but no worries, that's what I'm here for. :-D
