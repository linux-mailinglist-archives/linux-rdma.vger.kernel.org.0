I know you didn't, but as I didn't expect Jason to be familiar with the
camera ISP discussions, I didn't want to make any specific assumption
regarding what he meant by passthrough kernel driver design.

What is not an option exactly in my description above ? We have multiple
V4L2 drivers for ISPs. They receive ISP parameters from userspace
through a data buffer. It's not allowed to be opaque, but it doesn't
prevent vendor closed-source userspace implementations with additional
*camera* features, as long as the *hardware* features are available to
everybody.
