This is a brand new system, it's never been running with any kernel 
older than 5.4, and downgrading it to 4.19 or something else while in 
operation is unfortunately not easily possible. For a client it would 
definitely not be out of the question, but the main nfs server I cannot 
easily downgrade.

Also keep in mind that the dmesg spam happens on both server and client 
simultaneously.

I'll see if I can borrow two of the nodes to turn into a temporary test 
system for this.

The Kernel for this system is self-built and not any distribution 
kernel. This could not be a missing kernel config option or something?
