The last clause here is the operative conundrum: "when the remote
cannot respond". That should be pretty rare, but it's frequent
enough to be bothersome in some environments.

As to why the time wait is so long, I don't know the answer to that.

There is a complicated back-off scheme that is modeled on the TCP
connection back-off logic.
