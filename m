Latest mainline plus the series (which is about to get resent).
blk_queue_virt_boundary now forced an unlimited max_hw_sectors as that
is how PRP-like schemes work, to work around a block driver merging
bug.  But we also need to communicate that limit to the DMA layer so
that we don't set a smaller iommu segment size limitation.

No, there is no more limit for the size of the segment at all,
as for PRPs each PRP is sort of a segment from the hardware perspective.
We just require the segments to not have gaps, as PRPs don't allow for
that.

That being said I think these patches are wrong for the case of megaraid
or mpt having both NVMe and SAS/ATA devices behind a single controller.
Is that a valid configuration?
