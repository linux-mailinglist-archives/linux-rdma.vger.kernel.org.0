Parav, I think you completely missed the point of my email.

I was replying to Jiri saying that mdev does not fit the nfp/mlx4
mutli-port devices, and we still need a normal "PCI split" or something
along those lines to have multiple PF ports on one PF.

I'm not talking about your use of mdev at all.

The discussion on patch 12 also seems to indicate you don't read the
emails you reply to...
