After a couple of private exchanges, Tom and I agree that doing an
ib_query_qp() in rpcrdma_post_recvs() has some drawbacks and
does not fully close the race window.

There is nothing that prevents rpcrdma_xprt_disconnect() from starting
the RQ drain while rpcrdma_post_recvs is still running. There needs to
be serialization between ib_drain_rq() and rpcrdma_post_recvs() so
that the drain sentinel is guaranteed to be the final Receive WR posted
on the RQ.

It would be great if the core ib_drain_rq() API itself could handle the
exclusion.
