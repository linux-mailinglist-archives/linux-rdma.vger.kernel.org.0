Those may just be bad examples, but I think they showcase how little
these discussions are based on technical expertise and facts. Just
singling out one example, the convergence time is driven by the
userspace implementation of the ISP control algorithms. That is *not*
something we want to force vendors to disclose. It isn't related to the
ISP parameters and the UAPI the driver exposes to userspace.

That at least we agree on :-)

Closed kernel drivers are a GPL violation. Do you have any example, or
do you mean out-of-tree drivers ? I don't think out-of-tree vs. mainline
drivers would make much difference when it comes to reverse engineering,
if the mainline driver is just a pass-through driver.

I very much disagree with that.

It may be for you, but I don't think it is an accurate description for
the rest of the industry.
