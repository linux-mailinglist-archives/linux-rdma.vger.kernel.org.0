My config has "route_prot" set to "sa"

But ib_acme hangs? The main issue here is what the user space app does.
And we need ibacm to cache user space address resolutions.

I have always run it with that setting. How can I debug this issue and how
can we fix this?

Huh? IBACM is an address resolution service for IB. Somehow that only
includes addresses of hosts running IBACM?

Not here and not in the tests that RH ran to verify the issue.

"route_prot" set to "sa" is the default config for the Redhat release of
IBACM.

However, the addr_prot is set to  "acm" by default. I set it to "sa" with
no effect.
