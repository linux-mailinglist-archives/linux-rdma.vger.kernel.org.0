Actually erdma also need a net device binded to, and so does it.

These days Iâ€™m trying to find out acceptable ways to get the reference
of the binded netdev, e,g, the 'struct net_device' pointer. Unlike other
RDMA drivers can get the reference of their binded netdevs' reference 
easily (most RDMA devices are based on the extended aux devices), it is
a little more complex for erdma, because erdma and its binded net device
are two separated PCIe devices.

Then I find that the netdev reference hold in ibdev is rarely used
in core code for iWarp deivces, GID0 is the key attribute (As you and 
Tom mentioned, it appears with the historical need for compatibility,
but I think this is another story).

So, there are two choices for erdma: enum net devices and find the
matched one, or never calling ib_device_set_netdev. The second one has 
less code.

The second way can't work in ROCE. But it works for iWarp (I've tested),
since the netdev reference is rarely used for iWarp in core code, as I
said in last reply.

In short, the question discussed here is that: is it acceptable that
doesn't hold the netdev reference in core code for a iWarp driver
(indeed it has a netdev binded to) ? Or is it necessary that calling
ib_device_set_netdev to set the binded netdev for iWarp driver?

You and Tom both are specialists in iWarp, your opinions are important.

Thanks very much
