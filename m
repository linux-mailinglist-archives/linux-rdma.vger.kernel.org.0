It can be, typically up to O(num_cpus).

I get your suggestion. I agree that it's also pretty simple to 
implement, and that it tolerates bursts.

However, I think it softens the grace period role too much. It has an 
important disadvantage, as it tolerates non-bursts as well. It lacks the 
"burstness" distinguishability.

IMO current grace_period has multiple goals, among them:

a. let the auto-recovery mechanism handle errors as long as they are 
followed by some long-enough "healthy" intervals.

b. break infinite loop of auto-recoveries, when the "healthy" interval 
is not long enough. Raise a flag to mark the need for admin intervention.

In your proposal, the above doesn't hold.
It won't prevent the infinite auto-recovery loop for a buggy system that 
has a constant rate of up to X failures in N msecs.

One can argue that this can be addressed by increasing the grace_period. 
i.e. a current system with grace_period=N is intuitively moved to 
burst_size=X and grace_period=X*N.

But increasing the grace_period by such a large factor has 
over-enforcement and hurts legitimate auto-recoveries.

Again, the main point is, it lacks the ability to properly distinguish 
between 1. a "burst" followed by a healthy interval, and 2. a buggy 
system with a rate of repeated errors.

It is a simple generalization indeed.
But I don't agree it's a better filter.

Absolutely.
We discussed this exact same insight internally. The existing name is 
confusing, but we won't propose modifying it at this point.

It can be named after what it achieves (allows handling of more errors) 
or what it is (a shift of the grace_period). I'm fine with both, don't 
have strong preference.

I'd call it grace_period in case we didn't have one already :)

Please let me know what name you prefer.
