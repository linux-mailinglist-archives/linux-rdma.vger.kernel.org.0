The Linux NFS implementation is living. We can add the ability
to provision multiple chunks per RPC to the Linux NFS client at
any time.

Likewise any actively developed NFS/RDMA implementation can add
this feature. The RPC/RDMA version 1 protocol does not have the
ability to communicate the maximum number of chunks the server
will accept per RPC.

Other server implementations do support multiple chunks per RPC.
The Linux NFS/RDMA server implementation has always been incomplete
in this regard.

And the Linux NFS server implementation (the non-transport specific
part) already supports multiple data payloads per NFSv4 COMPOUND.


Restoring a little more of the cover letter:

The Linux NFS/RDMA server implementation does need to have better
input sanitization.

And there is a version 2 of RPC/RDMA under active development:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-nfsv4-rpcrdma-version-two/

Having some protocol version agnosticism in our transport might
be necessary eventually.
