I am in search of a property to buy in your country



This is one of those stories that won=E2=80=99t come easy. It=E2=80=99s gen=
uinely one
where I=E2=80=99ll have to =E2=80=9Csit down and open a vein.=E2=80=9DIt=E2=
=80=99s very personal, and
maybe I should not speak publicly about it, but I need your help,I
have no desire to hide any part of my life. Because, through it all, I
know I did the best I could. A lot of things happen as a result of
people looking back into their homes. There haven=E2=80=99t been too many
unexpected revelations in my family=E2=80=99s case, although we discovered =
a
few surprising fact



I am in search of a property to buy in your country; I intended to
come over to your country for investment? I believe that I have to
partner with a citizen to be safe in investing in your country. My
name is Ms. Ansley Hansen Hamdok, My late husband deals on Crude Oil
with Federal Government of Sudan and we have a private Oil firm in
Bentiu Oil zone town and Upper Nile city.

What I have experience physically, I don't wish to experience it again
in my life due to the recent civil and Ethnic crises caused by our
President Mr. Salva Kiir and the rebel leader Mr. Riek Machar, I have
been Under United Nation refugee camp in Rue De Bass am west Africa,
to save my life and that of my little daughter.


I want to solicit for your partnership with trust to transfer and
invest with my fund deposited at Bank by my late husband, I will
disclose the Amount to you as we proceed. I need your help to move
this fund to your country, because my life is no longer safe in
Africa, since the rebels are looking for the families of all the oil
business partners in the country, very scaring I wish you will
understand my predicaments.

But the truth is that I and my daughter was lucky to be part of the
badge taken by UN KEEPING FORCE to Addis Ababa our Neighboring country
where we took a flight to Abidjan Ivory Coast, We left Sudan and move
to Addis Ababa our neighboring country with the few days ceasefire
which was announced by United Nation Peace keeping Force., Because of
face-to-face peace meeting accord coordinated by US Secretary of
State, and United Nations in Ethiopia (Addis Ababa) between The
sitting President Mr. Salva Kiir and the rebel leader Mr. Riek Machar
to stop this war.

I will send you the document of the fund with other details for your
acknowledgement and prove.


With love from
Ms.Ansley Hansen Hamdok
