checkpatch.pl checks it or supposed to check.

commit a8dd86bf746256fbf68f82bc13356244c5ad8efa

    checkpatch.pl: warn on invalid commit id

    It can happen that a commit message refers to an invalid commit id,
    because the referenced hash changed following a rebase, or simply by
    mistake.  Add a check in checkpatch.pl which checks that an hash
    referenced by a Fixes tag, or just cited in the commit message, is a valid
    commit id.

        $ scripts/checkpatch.pl <<'EOF'
