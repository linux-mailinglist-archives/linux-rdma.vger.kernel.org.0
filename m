Yep.

It seems that is a Maintainers preference.

It certainly does check Fixes: lines for correctness. Lately, it's
been warning about commit IDs that are not exactly 12 hexits long,
and cases where the commit ID does not actually exist in the local
repository.

It used to complain about "..." as well, until someone said that is
a frequently-used modification to keep the line length manageable.
I think that might be why checkpatch.pl no longer checks the tag's
short description.

Maybe not, but I don't think that's always been the case. <shrug>

I didn't invent the Fixes: tag, and I didn't invent shortening it.
That had to come from somewhere as well. So here we are.

No matter, though. Now that I know this community's preference, I
will stick to it. Will you take "yes" for an answer? ;-)
