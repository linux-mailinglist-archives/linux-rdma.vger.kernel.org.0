This is a bit of a trick question, since there seem to be three
separate but intertwined things here

   1. What to do about cross subsystem NAKs (as in how far does one
      subsystem have the ability to NAK something another does because
      they fear it will impact them ... passthrough being only one
      example).
   2. Industry education to help manufacturers making bad decisions
      about openness and APIs make better ones that actually benefit
      their business in the long run.
   3. Standards for open drivers (i.e. is passthrough always evil).

1. is definitely Maintainer Summit material. 2. was something the LF
used to help us with but seems to have foundered of late (I think on
the general assumption that CNCF gets it right, so we can stop pushing)
and 3. is definitely where Plumbers could host a wide ranging debate.
