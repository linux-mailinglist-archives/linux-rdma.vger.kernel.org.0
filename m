I don't know what Jason had in mind, but I can see a use for that for
writing to doorbells of a device.
Today, usually what happens is that peer A reads/writes to peer B's
memory through the large bar and then signals the host the operation
was completed.
Then the host s/w writes to the doorbell of the peer B to let him know
he can continue with the execution as the data is now ready (or can be
recycled).
I can imagine peer A writing directly to the doorbell of peer B, and
usually for that we would like to expose a very small area, probably a
single 4K page.
