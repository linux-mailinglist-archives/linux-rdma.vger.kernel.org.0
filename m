Ok, well, that's 1.2% error rate, which IMO could be cranked up much
higher for testing purposes. I'd also be sure the server was serving
other workloads during the same time, putting at least some pressure
on the DRC. The op rate of a single nfsidem test is pretty low so I
doubt it's ever evicting anything.

Ideally, it would be best to
1) increase the error probability
2) run several concurrent nfsidem tests, on different connections
3) apply some other load to the server, e.g. several cthon basics

The idea being to actually get the needle off of zero and measure some
kind of difference. Otherwise it really isn't giving any information
apart from a slight didn't-break-it confidence. Honestly, I'm surprised
you couldn't evince a failure from stock. On paper, these results don't
actually tell us the patch is doing anything.
