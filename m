The most common reason for a flushed work request is loss of
the connection to the remote peer. This can be caused by any
number of conditions.

The second-most common is a programming error in the upper
layer protocol. A shortage of posted receives on either peer,
a protection error on some buffer, etc.

If you're looking to actually trigger this error for testing,
well, try one of the above. If you're trying to figure out
why it's happening, that can take some digging, but not in
the RDMA stack, typically.
