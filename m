Thanks. That helped. Adding traces for QP references turned up the 
problem. Someone took a reference on QP in send_atomic_ack() that is 
never matched by a drop reference. The logic was probably to protect the 
QP from going away while it held an atomic responder resource. The 
problem is that since the requester can retry the operation multiple 
times the responder never knows when to free the resource so it doesn't. 
It just recycles them FIFO when a new atomic request comes along. They 
are looked up by PSN. So the only logical solution is to not take the 
extra reference. If you destroy the QP while a requester is retrying 
atomic operations it just fails.

I'll submit a patch deleting one line.

Bob
