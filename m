I would also like to discuss this in more details, but I can't do so
publicly :-( That's why I don't want to focus too much on this argument.

That's exactly what I previously described in this mail thread as areas
where cooperation with vendors is in its infancy. Convincing large
industry players is long term work, and it's very demotivating when you
think there's finally light at the end of the tunel, and plans gets
cancelled at the last minute. We're not giving up though.

Can you get all the camera vendors you work with to talk about all this
openly ? :-) We all know it's a difficult and long process.

I don't agree with that. Not only are there different manufacturers,
there are also different teams, with different approaches. The world is
not uniform.

Because we're the only ones to be blamed, or more accuretely, the blame
is solely on me. Vendors are all saints who want the best for the world.
This argument doesn't hold. Please stop with this, I don't want to get
to name calling.
