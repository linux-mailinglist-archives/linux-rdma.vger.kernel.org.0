Ok, good to know. I forgot that the Linux server implemented this.
I have some concerns abot it, honestly, and it's important to remember
that it's not the same on all servers. But for the problem you're
fixing, it's ok I guess and certainly better than today. Still, the
errors are goingto be completely silent, and can lead to data being
corrupted. Well, welcome to the world of NFSv3.

I just want to interject here that this is completely irrelevant.
The server can't know what these clients are doing, or expecting.
One case that might work is not any kind of evidence, and is not
a workaround.

Ok, good. But I have a better test.

In the Connectathon suite, there's a "Special" test called "nfsidem".
I wrote this test in, like, 1989 so I remember it :-)

This test performs all the non-idempotent NFv3 operations in a loop,
and each loop element depends on the previous one, so if there's
any failure, the test imemdiately bombs.

Nobody seems to understand it, usually when it gets run people will
run it without injecting errors, and it "passes" so they decide
everything is ok.

So my suggestion is to run your flakeway packet-drop harness while
running nfsidem in a huge loop (nfsidem 10000). The test is slow,
owing to the expensive operations it performs, so you'll need to
run it for a long time.

You'll almost definitely get a failure or two, since the NFSv3
protocol is flawed by design. But you can compare the behaviors,
and even compute a likelihood. I'd love to see some actual numbers.

Agreed!
