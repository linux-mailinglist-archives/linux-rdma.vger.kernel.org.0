Correction: My testing _used_ _to_ generate REJECTED events regularly. =
It does
not seem to any more, even after client crashes. So that explains why I =
haven't
seen this before.

I haven't reproduced the problem here, but the fix still looks proper to =
me,
and doesn't appear to introduce any regressions. I do have some issues =
with your
proposed patch, though.

The first paragraph of the patch description is incorrect. =
RDMA_CM_EVENT_DISCONNECTED
can occur only once a connection has been established. That guarantees =
there are no
waiters on re_connect_wait in that case. It's connect errors that need =
to wake-up
the connect worker.


>> This continues the fix in commit 58bd6656f808 ('xprtrdma: Restore =
wake-up-all to
>> rpcrdma_cm_event_handler()').

IMO this paragraph needs to be replaced by:

Fixes: e28ce90083f0 ("xprtrdma: kmalloc rpcrdma_ep separate from =
rpcrdma_xprt")

This hunk does not apply on top of fixes I've already sent to Anna for =
5.8-rc1.

So, if you don't object, I'll adjust your patch (this hunk and the =
description)
before sending it along to Anna.
