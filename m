Well, I could be easily convinced to remove the Cc: stable
for this one, since it's not a full fix. But this is a pretty pervasive
problem with disconnect handling.

True, but it's done only once every 7 Receive completions.

The other option is to use re_connect_status, and add some memory
barriers to ensure we get the latest value. That doesn't help us get the
race window closed any further, though.

Agreed 100%. I just couldn't think of a better approach. I'm definitely open
to better ideas.

It's not an issue with batching, it's an issue with posting Receives from the
Receive completion handler. I'd think that any of the ULPs that post Receives
in their completion handler would have the same issue.

The purpose of the QP drain in rpcrdma_xprt_disconnect() is to ensure there
are no more WRs in flight so that the hardware resources can be safely
destroyed. If the Receive completion handler continues to post Receive WRs
after the drain sentinel has been posted, leaks and crashes become possible.
