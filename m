The test topology was used to check the performance between
cpu_local_spread() and the new approach is :
Case 1
IRQ     Nodes  Cores CPUs
0       1      0     0-1
1       1      1     2-3
2       1      2     4-5
3       1      3     6-7

and with existing cpu_local_spread()
Case 2
IRQ    Nodes  Cores CPUs
0      1      0     0
1      1      0     1
2      1      1     2
3      1      1     3

Total 4 channels were used, which was set up by ethtool.
case 1 with ntttcp has given 15 percent better performance, than
case 2. During the test irqbalance was disabled as well.

Also you are right, with 64CPU system this approach will spread
the irqs like the cpu_local_spread() but in the future we will offer
MANA nodes, with more than 64 CPUs. There it this new design will 
give better performance.

I will add this performance benefit details in commit message of
next version.
