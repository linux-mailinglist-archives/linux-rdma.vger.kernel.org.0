Both kernels below have a number of CPU-intensive debugging options enabled, which might tend to increase CPU cycles per byte or per I/O, and might also amplify the differences between the two kernels.

Ah, the math I suggested earlier needs a different approah for these
absolute utilizations. The >100% numbers indicate these are per-core,
so 164% means 1.64 cores' worth of load. The math I suggested is for
relative, where the core count is corrected to 100% total.

For these, ignore the core count, just take the frequency and multiply
by the percent. This means your cpb and cpio numbers are 12X the value.
It's no big deal since we're just comparing before/after though.

So, 62cpb and and 63Kcpio, corrected. Seems a bit high, but as I said
earlier, it's hard to compare across platforms.

Well, close, but noticably lower in the pullup approach. This bears
out your suspicion that the IOMMU is not a trivial cost. It's also
likely to be a single-threading point, which will cause queuing as
well as overhead. Of course, the cost may be worth it, for security,
or scatter/gather optimization, etc. But for small i/o, the pullup
is a simple and effective approach.

Excellent result. The backlog wait may be in part avoiding the IOMMU
programming, and queuing on it before mapping. Bringing the numbers
close to READ corroborates this. I assume you are using RoCE or IB,
which doesn't require remote registration of the source buffers? The
pullup would improve those even more.

Curious that the RTT goes up by such a large number. It seems really
high. This might become a noticable penalty on single-threaded
(metadata) workloads.
