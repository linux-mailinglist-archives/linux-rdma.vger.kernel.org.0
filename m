I know we disagree on this topic :-) I'm sure we'll continue the
conversation, but I think the technical discussion likely belongs to a
different mail thread.

This point isn't technical and is more on-topic for this mail thread.

V4L2 doesn't require hundreds of pages of comprehensive documentation in
text form. An open-source userspace implementation that covers the
feature set exposed by the driver is acceptable in place of
documentation (provided, of course, that the userspace code wouldn't be
deliberately obfuscated). This is similar in spirit to the rule for GPU
DRM drivers.

V4L2 does as well, you can implement all kind of closed-source ISP
control algorithms in userspace, as long as there's an open-source
implementation that exercises the same hardware features. A good analogy
for people less familiar with ISPs is shader compilers, GPU vendors are
free to ship closed-source implementations that include more
optimizations, as long as the open-source, less optimized implementation
covers the same GPU ISA, so that open-source developers can also work on
optimizing it.

Thinking that DRM would offer a free pass-through path compared to V4L2
doesn't seem realistic to me. Both subsystems will have similar rules.
