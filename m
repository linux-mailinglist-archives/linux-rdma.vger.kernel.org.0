Yeah, I understand what you concern about. I'm sorry that there may be
ambiguity in my last reply.

After discussed internally, we would like to drop this patch (e.g., failing
WRs before drain, or failing WRs in QP Error State), because it indeed has problem
in the cases you mentioned. And we are seeking for new solutions. New solutions
will not failing the WRs in drain cases, and by this erdma will have the same behavior
with other vendors.

More, the reason why we introduced this patch is that our hardware do not flush
newly WRs in QP Error State currently. So new solutions could be:
 - Let our hardware flush newly WRs, or
 - Flush WRs in our driver if hardware does not flush.
Either of them will eliminate the odd logic in this patch. For now, we tend the
first option.

Thanks,
Cheng Xu
