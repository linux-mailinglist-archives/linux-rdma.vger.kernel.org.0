[This email was generated by a script.  Let me know if you have any suggestions
to make it better.]

Of the currently open syzbot reports against the upstream kernel, I've manually
marked 11 of them as possibly being bugs in the RDMA subsystem.  I've listed
these reports below, sorted by an algorithm that tries to list first the reports
most likely to be still valid, important, and actionable.

Of these 11 bugs, 1 was seen in mainline in the last week.

Of these 11 bugs, 1 was bisected to a commit from the following person:

	Yishai Hadas <yishaih@mellanox.com>

If you believe a bug is no longer valid, please close the syzbot report by
sending a '#syz fix', '#syz dup', or '#syz invalid' command in reply to the
original thread, as explained at https://goo.gl/tpsmEJ#status

If you believe I misattributed a bug to the RDMA subsystem, please let me know,
and if possible forward the report to the correct people or mailing list.

Here are the bugs:
