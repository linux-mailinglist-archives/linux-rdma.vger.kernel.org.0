Hi Anna-

Can you include this series in your next pull request to Trond?

Trond, 

This series addresses your concern about xprtrdma using the 
rq_rcv_buf.tail vector in some cases to receive an XDR pad. It has
been tested with a legacy Solaris server, in addition to the usual
tests I run.

We haven't yet confirmed whether this addresses the GPU-Direct
issue, but since that is an out-of-tree user that depends on 
unsupported kernel facilities, I regard that confirmation as only
"nice to have", not mandatory. We are confident this change will
address that situation, based on our understanding of the issue.

Changes since v2:
- Address more review comments from Tom Talpey
