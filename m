Two in one go:
- it is allowed to call dma_fence_wait() while holding a
  dma_resv_lock(). This is fundamental to how eviction works with ttm,
  so required.

- it is allowed to call dma_fence_wait() from memory reclaim contexts,
  specifically from shrinker callbacks (which i915 does), and from mmu
  notifier callbacks (which amdgpu does, and which i915 sometimes also
  does, and probably always should, but that's kinda a debate). Also
  for stuff like HMM we really need to be able to do this, or things
  get real dicey.

Consequence is that any critical path necessary to get to a
dma_fence_signal for a fence must never a) call dma_resv_lock nor b)
allocate memory with GFP_KERNEL. Also by implication of
dma_resv_lock(), no userspace faulting allowed. That's some supremely
obnoxious limitations, which is why we need to sprinkle the right
annotations to all relevant paths.

The one big locking context we're leaving out here is mmu notifiers,
added in

Author: Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>

    mm/mmu_notifiers: add a lockdep map for invalidate_range_start/end

that one covers a lot of other callsites, and it's also allowed to
wait on dma-fences from mmu notifiers. But there's no ready-made
functions exposed to prime this, so I've left it out for now.

v2: Also track against mmu notifier context.

v3: kerneldoc to spec the cross-driver contract. Note that currently
i915 throws in a hard-coded 10s timeout on foreign fences (not sure
why that was done, but it's there), which is why that rule is worded
with SHOULD instead of MUST.

Also some of the mmu_notifier/shrinker rules might surprise SoC
drivers, I haven't fully audited them all. Which is infeasible anyway,
we'll need to run them with lockdep and dma-fence annotations and see
what goes boom.

v4: A spelling fix from Mika

+/**
+ * DOC: fence cross-driver contract
+ *
+ * Since &dma_fence provide a cross driver contract, all drivers must follow the
+ * same rules:
+ *
+ * * Fences must complete in a reasonable time. Fences which represent kernels
+ *   and shaders submitted by userspace, which could run forever, must be backed
+ *   up by timeout and gpu hang recovery code. Minimally that code must prevent
+ *   further command submission and force complete all in-flight fences, e.g.
+ *   when the driver or hardware do not support gpu reset, or if the gpu reset
+ *   failed for some reason. Ideally the driver supports gpu recovery which only
+ *   affects the offending userspace context, and no other userspace
+ *   submissions.
+ *
+ * * Drivers may have different ideas of what completion within a reasonable
+ *   time means. Some hang recovery code uses a fixed timeout, others a mix
+ *   between observing forward progress and increasingly strict timeouts.
+ *   Drivers should not try to second guess timeout handling of fences from
+ *   other drivers.
+ *
+ * * To ensure there's no deadlocks of dma_fence_wait() against other locks
+ *   drivers should annotate all code required to reach dma_fence_signal(),
+ *   which completes the fences, with dma_fence_begin_signalling() and
+ *   dma_fence_end_signalling().
+ *
+ * * Drivers are allowed to call dma_fence_wait() while holding dma_resv_lock().
+ *   This means any code required for fence completion cannot acquire a
+ *   &dma_resv lock. Note that this also pulls in the entire established
+ *   locking hierarchy around dma_resv_lock() and dma_resv_unlock().
+ *
+ * * Drivers are allowed to call dma_fence_wait() from their &shrinker
+ *   callbacks. This means any code required for fence completion cannot
+ *   allocate memory with GFP_KERNEL.
+ *
+ * * Drivers are allowed to call dma_fence_wait() from their &mmu_notifier
+ *   respectively &mmu_interval_notifier callbacks. This means any code required
+ *   for fence completeion cannot allocate memory with GFP_NOFS or GFP_NOIO.
+ *   Only GFP_ATOMIC is permissible, which might fail.
