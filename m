But "perfect storm" of:

 + global fence lockmap
 + mmu notifiers
 + fs reclaim
 + default annotations in dma_fence_signal / dma_fence_wait

Equals to anything ever using dma_fence will be in impossible chains with random other drivers, even if neither driver has code to export/share that fence.

Example from the CI run:

 [25.918788] Chain exists of:
  fs_reclaim --> mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start --> dma_fence_map
 [25.918794]  Possible unsafe locking scenario:
 [25.918797]        CPU0                    CPU1
 [25.918799]        ----                    ----
 [25.918801]   lock(dma_fence_map);
 [25.918803]                                lock(mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start);
 [25.918807]                                lock(dma_fence_map);
 [25.918809]   lock(fs_reclaim);

What about a dma_fence_export helper which would "arm" the annotations? It would be called as soon as the fence is exported. Maybe when added to dma_resv, or exported via sync_file, etc. Before that point begin/end_signaling and so would be no-ops.

How do I see in lockdep splats if it was a read or write user? Your patch appears to have:

dma_fence_signal:
+	lock_acquire(&dma_fence_lockdep_map, 0, 0, 1, 1, NULL, _RET_IP_);

__dma_fence_might_wait:
+	lock_acquire(&dma_fence_lockdep_map, 0, 0, 1, 1, NULL, _THIS_IP_);

Which both seem like read lock. I don't fully understand the lockdep API so I might be wrong, not sure. But neither I see a difference in splats telling me which path is which.
