I wondered what happened to this, as this looks stalled. Or was progress
to fix this regression made I just missed it?

I noticed the patch "net/mlx5: Fix irq affinity management" (
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230523054242.21596-15-saeed@kernel.org/
) refers to the culprit of this regression. Is that supposed to fix this
issue and just lacks proper tags to indicate that?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
