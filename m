Yes, something like this. And good to know, never heard of ODP.


On the GPU side we can pipeline things, e.g. you can program the 
hardware that page tables are changed at a certain point in time.

So what we do is when we get a notification that a buffer will move 
around is to mark this buffer in our structures as invalid and return a 
fence to so that the exporter is able to wait for ongoing stuff to finish.

The actual move then happens only after the ongoing operations on the 
GPU are finished and on the next operation we grab the new location of 
the buffer and re-program the page tables to it.

This way all the CPU does is really just planning asynchronous page 
table changes which are executed on the GPU later on.

You can of course do it synchronized as well, but this would hurt our 
performance pretty badly.

Regards,
Christian.
