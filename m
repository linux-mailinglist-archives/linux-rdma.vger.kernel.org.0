Thanks for looking into this.

Not sure that's the same source port that is visible to the
NFS server's transport accept logic. That's the one that
matters to the DRC. Certainly IB fabrics wouldn't have an IP
source port like this.

For RoCE (and perhaps iWARP) that port number would be the
same for all transports from the client. Still not useful
for adding entropy to a DRC entry hash.

Can you add a printk to your server to show the port value
in cm_id->route.addr.dst_addr?

I suspect this would be part of the RDMA Connection Manager
interface, not part of the RDMA driver code.
