That's not actually true, e.g. some power system definitively had it,
althiugh I don't know if the current ones do.

But that's not that point.  The offset is a configuration fully
supported by Linux, and someone that just works by using the proper
APIs.  Doing some handwaiving about embedded only or bad design doesn't
matter.  There is a reason why we have these proper APIs and no one
has any business bypassing them.

I think the offset is one of the reasons why IOVA windows can be
reserved (and maybe also why ppc is so weird).

Well, if it also solves the other issue of invalid scatterlists leaking
outside of drm we can think about it.

Yes, __iommu_dma_map creates an IOVA for the mapped remote BAR.  That
is the right thing if the I/O goes through the host bridge, but it is
the wrong thing if the I/O goes through the switch - in that case the
IOVA generated is not something that the endpoint that owns the BAR
can even understand.

Take a look at iommu_dma_map_sg and pci_p2pdma_map_segment to see how
this is handled.
