Hi Leon, thanks for taking a look. Responses below.

The goal of this patch is to deduplicate that "similar logic".
Callers that implement this logic already can use
RDMA_CORE_ANY_COMPVEC and get rid of their own copy.

We could create a new CQ allocation API that does not take a
comp vector. That might be cleaner than passing in a -1.

But I think some ULPs still want to use the existing API to
allocate one CQ for each of a device's comp vectors.

I don't believe it is.

H=C3=A5kon has convinced me that assigning interrupt vectors to
CPUs is in the domain of user space (ie, driven by policy).
In addition, one assumes that taking a CPU offline properly
will also involve re-assigning interrupt vectors that point
to that core.

In any event, this code can be modified after it is merged
if it is necessary to accommodate such requirements.
