Can you please send removal patches together with this API proposal?
It will ensure that ULPs authors will notice such changes and we won't
end with special function for one ULP.

+1

It can be "legacy implementation", which is not really needed,
but I don't really know about it.

It is a simple change, which is worth to do now as long as
we have interested parties involved here.
