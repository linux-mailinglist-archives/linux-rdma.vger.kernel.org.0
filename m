+1. And we also rely on the above 'slow path' to flush old nid-mismatched pages
and refill new pages from the correct nid, see the nid checking and updating in
page_pool_refill_alloc_cache() and page_pool_update_nid() when irq migrates
between different numa nodes as it seems common for linux distributions to use
irqbalance to tune performance.

The below is a recent UAF for a page, I guess it can be said that this
patch seem to basically make mmap_min_addr mechanism useless for the above
arches when a driver with page_pool dma mapping support is loaded:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/Z878K7JQ93LqBdCB@casper.infradead.org/

So how about logging a warning so that user can tell if their system may
be in security compromised state for the above case?

Toke used my data in [2] below:
The above 400ns is the added cost of those extra operations on the slow path,
before this patch the slow path only cost about 170ns, so there is more than
200% performance degradation for the page tracking in this patch, which I
failed to see why it is acceptable:(
