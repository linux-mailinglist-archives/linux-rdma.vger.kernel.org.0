Doing I/O to memory which does not have a struct page is the whole point
of this series (and many many more patches to come in the future).

This is very useful functionality to have.  Xen can do it, which is
advantageous for a hypervisor as it really doesn't use the struct page
for anything; that memory is assigned to the guest and the host only
needs the page in order to do I/O on belaf of the guest.

I first came up against this problem with the 3DXP project, which is now
dead but there are other similar projects that involve giving each
machine in a cluster access to a large amount of shared memory, and
there's not really a good place to allocate the memmap from.
And the only reason to allocate memmap is so that we can do I/O to
this memory.

I'm sure there are other use cases.  Given that nVidia are so
interested in this, I would guess that at least one of them involves
a graphics card.

I don't think that phys_to_virt() is something that has ever been
guaranteed to work (HIGHEMEM and so on).  I do think that we should
support kmap_local_phys() for these things -- there's no need to
have a struct page for that.

I haven't looked at the implementation, but I think we need to agree
that this is useful functionality to have, or this isn't going anywhere.
