Is there any season you think only kernel pointer is relevant here?
It seems it is not really only about kernel pointers as round_hint_to_min()
in mm/mmap.c suggests and the commit log in the above commit 8a5e5e02fc83
if I understand it correctly:
"Given unprivileged users cannot mmap anything below mmap_min_addr, it
should be safe to use poison pointers lower than mmap_min_addr."

And the above "making sure the top-most bit is always 0" doesn't seems to
ensure page->signature to be outside the range used for kernel pointers
for 32-bit arches with VMSPLIT_1G defined, see arch/arm/Kconfig, there
is a similar config for x86 too:
       prompt "Memory split"
       depends on MMU
       default VMSPLIT_3G
       help
         Select the desired split between kernel and user memory.

         If you are not absolutely sure what you are doing, leave this
         option alone!

       config VMSPLIT_3G
              bool "3G/1G user/kernel split"
       config VMSPLIT_3G_OPT
             depends on !ARM_LPAE
              bool "3G/1G user/kernel split (for full 1G low memory)"
       config VMSPLIT_2G
              bool "2G/2G user/kernel split"
       config VMSPLIT_1G
              bool "1G/3G user/kernel split"

IMHO, even if some trick like above is really feasible, it may be
adding some limitation or complexity to the ARCH and MM subsystem, for
example, stashing the ID in page->signature may cause 0x*40 signature
to be unusable for other poison pointer purpose, it makes more sense to
make it obvious by doing the above trick in some MM header file like
poison.h instead of in the page_pool subsystem.

It is still the datapath otherwise there isn't a specific testing
for that use case, more than 200% performance degradation is too much
IHMO.

Let aside the above severe performance degradation, reusing space in
page->signature seems to be a tradeoff between adding complexity in
page_pool subsystem and in VM/ARCH subsystem as mentioned above.

It seems the XA_DEBUG is not defined in production environment.
And I am not familiar enough with BPF program to understand if the
BPF way is feasiable in production environment.
Any example for the above BPF program and how to attach it?
