Filesystems like xfs and ext4 that closed additional block devices (For
example, the logdev= mount option for xfs.) in put_super() could go
through stuff like:

blkdev_put()
-> bdev->bd_disk->fops->release() == lo_release()
   -> __loop_clr_fd()
      -> disk_force_media_change()
         -> __invalidate_device()
            -> get_super()

which wouldn't have been a problem before because get_super() matched on
sb->s_bdev which obviously doesn't work because a log device or rt
device or whatever isn't the main block device. So we couldn't have
deadlocked.

But the fact that it is called in that manner from that place in the
first place is wildly adventurous especially considering that there
isn't __a single comment__ in that code why that is safe. So good luck
figuring this all out.

Now that we don't have to do that s_bdev matching thing anymore because
we directly associate the superblock with the block device we can go
straight from block device to superblock. But now calling blkdev_put()
under put_super() which holds s_umount could deadlock. So it's moved to
kill_sb where it should've always been called. Even without the
potential deadlock in the new scheme that's cleaner and easier to
understand imho and it just works for any block device.

Yes, that I did fix as far as I'm aware. If the rules would've been
written down where when something was freed we would've had an easier
time figuring this out though. But they weren't so we missed it.

> Documentation/filesystems/porting being the right place; any development

Yes, agreed. I'll write a document for Christoph's next version.

I know that what you're saying is roughly that we shouldn't make the
same mistake as were done before but the fact that the old lifetime
rules weren't documented in any meaningful way and now we get grumbled
at in turn makes me grumble a bit. :) But overall point duly taken.

Let me write something up.

Cool, thanks for adding that.
