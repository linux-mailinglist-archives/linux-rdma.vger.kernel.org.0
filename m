"Constantly" is a bit of a stretch - IIRC, we grabbed sb_lock once, then
went through the list comparing ->s_bdev (without any extra locking),
then bumped ->s_count on the found superblock, dropped sb_lock,
grabbed ->s_umount on the sucker and verified it's still alive.

Repeated grabbing of any lock happened only on a race with fs shutdown;
normal case is one spin_lock, one spin_unlock, one down_read().

Oh, well...

What *are* these lifetime rules?  Seriously, you have 3 chunks of
fs-dependent actions at the moment:
	* the things needed to get rid of internal references pinning
inodes/dentries + whatever else we need done before generic_shutdown_super()
	* the stuff to be done between generic_shutdown_super() and
making the sucker invisible to sget()/sget_fc()
	* the stuff that must be done after we are sure that sget
callbacks won't be looking at this instance.

Note that Christoph's series has mashed (2) and (3) together, resulting
in UAF in a bunch of places.  And I'm dead serious about
Documentation/filesystems/porting being the right place; any development
tree of any filesystem (in-tree one or not) will have to go through the
changes and figure out WTF to do with their existing code.  We are
going to play whack-a-mole for at least several years as development
branches get rebased and merged.

Incidentally, I'm going to add a (belated by 10 years) chunk in porting.rst
re making sure that anything in superblock that might be needed by methods
called in RCU mode should *not* be freed without an RCU delay...  Should've
done that back in 3.12 merge window when RCU'd vfsmounts went in; as it
is, today we have several filesystems with exact same kind of breakage.
hfsplus and affs breakage had been there in 3.13 (missed those two), exfat
and ntfs3 - introduced later, by initial merges of filesystems in question.
Missed on review...

Hell knows - perhaps Documentation/filesystems/whack-a-mole might be a good
idea...
