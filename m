Um... I am not sure that answered it, especially in the context of
cgroup (this is just for my curiosity btw, I don't know much about
rdma.)  You said sysadmins are less interested in application
specifics but then how would they make the judgement call on how much
"device memory" is provisioned to one application/container over
another (let say you have 5 cgroup sharing an rdma device)?  What are
the consequences of under provisioning "device memory" to an
application?  And if they are all just memory, can a sysadmin
provision more system memory in place of device memory (like, are they
interchangeable)?  I guess I am confused because if device memory is
just memory (not rdma, nic specific) to sysadmins how would they know
to set the right amount?
