POISON_POINTER_DELTA is defined according to CONFIG_ILLEGAL_POINTER_VALUE,
if CONFIG_ILLEGAL_POINTER_VALUE is not defined yet, POISON_POINTER_DELTA
is defined to zero.

It seems only the below 64-bit arches define CONFIG_ILLEGAL_POINTER_VALUE
through grepping:
a29815a333c6 core, x86: make LIST_POISON less deadly
5c178472af24 riscv: define ILLEGAL_POINTER_VALUE for 64bit
f6853eb561fb powerpc/64: Define ILLEGAL_POINTER_VALUE for 64-bit
bf0c4e047324 arm64: kconfig: Move LIST_POISON to a safe value

The below 64-bit arches don't seems to define the above config yet:
MIPS64, SPARC64, System z(S390X),loongarch

Does ID stashing cause problem for the above arches?

The above mainly explained how to ensure page_pool_page_is_pp() will
not return false positive result from the page_pool perspective.

From MM/security perspective, most of the commits quoted above seem
to suggest that poison pointer should be in the non-mmap'able or
hardly-mmap'able space, otherwise userspace can arrange for those
pointers to actually be dereferencable, potentially turning an oops
to an expolit, more detailed example in the below paper, which explains
how to exploit a vulnerability which hardened by the 8a5e5e02fc83 commit:
https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot15/woot15-paper-xu.pdf

ID stashing seems to cause page->lru.next (aliased to page->pp_magic) to
be in the mmap'able space for some arches.

It seems there was attempt of doing 4G/4G split too, and that is the kind
of limitation or complexity added to the ARCH and MM subsystem by doing the
ID stashing I mentioned earlier.

All I asked is about moving PP_MAGIC_MASK macro into poison.h if you
still want to proceed with reusing the page->pp_magic as the masking and
the signature to be masked seems reasonable to be in the same file.

To be honest, I am not that familiar with the pointer poison mechanism.
But through some researching and analyzing, it makes sense to overstate
it a little as it seems to be security-related.
Cc'ed some security-related experts and ML to see if there is some
clarifying from them.
