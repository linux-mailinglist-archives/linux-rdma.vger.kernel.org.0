Hm, I think that characterization of Christoph's changes is a bit harsh.

Yes, you're right that making the superblock and not the filesytem type
the bd_holder changes the logic and we are aware of that of course. And
it requires changes such as moving additional block device closing from
where some callers currently do it.

But the filesytem type is not a very useful holder itself and has other
drawbacks. The obvious one being that it requires us to wade through all
superblocks on the system trying to find the superblock associated with
a given block device continously grabbing and dropping sb_lock and
s_umount. None of that is very pleasant nor elegant and it is for sure
not very easy to understand (Plus, it's broken for btrfs freezing and
syncing via block level ioctls.).

Using the superblock as holder makes this go away and is overall a lot
more useful and intuitive and can be extended to filesystems with
multiple devices (Of which we apparently are bound to get more.).

So I think this change is worth the pain.

It's a fair point that these lifetime rules should be documented in
Documentation/filesystems/. The old lifetime documentation is too sparse
to be useful though.
