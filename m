From the mapping device's driver's perspective yes, but from the
perspective of a submitting driver they would be the same.

Yes, you did suggest them. But what I'm trying to suggest is we don't
*necessarily* need the lookup. For demonstration purposes only, a
submitting driver could very roughly potentially do:

struct bio_vec vec;
dist = pci_p2pdma_dist(provider_pdev, mapping_pdev);
if (dist < 0) {
     /* use regular memory */
     vec.bv_addr = virt_to_phys(kmalloc(...));
     vec.bv_flags = 0;
} else if (dist & PCI_P2PDMA_THRU_HOST_BRIDGE) {
     vec.bv_addr = pci_p2pmem_alloc_phys(provider_pdev, ...);
     vec.bv_flags = BVEC_MAP_RESOURCE;
} else {
     vec.bv_addr = pci_p2pmem_alloc_bus_addr(provider_pdev, ...);
     vec.bv_flags = BVEC_MAP_BUS_ADDR;
}

-- And a mapping driver would roughly just do:

dma_addr_t dma_addr;
if (vec.bv_flags & BVEC_MAP_BUS_ADDR) {
     if (pci_bus_addr_in_bar(mapping_pdev, vec.bv_addr, &bar, &off))  {
          /* case (c) */
          /* program the DMA engine with bar and off */
     } else {
          /* case (b2) */
          dma_addr = vec.bv_addr;
     }
} else if (vec.bv_flags & BVEC_MAP_RESOURCE) {
     /* case (b1) */
     dma_addr = dma_map_resource(mapping_dev, vec.bv_addr, ...);
} else {
     /* case (a) */
     dma_addr = dma_map_page(..., phys_to_page(vec.bv_addr), ...);
}

The real difficulty here is that you'd really want all the above handled
by a dma_map_bvec() so it can combine every vector hitting the IOMMU
into a single continuous IOVA -- but it's hard to fit case (c) into that
equation. So it might be that a dma_map_bvec() handles cases (a), (b1)
and (b2) and the mapping driver has to then check each resulting DMA
vector for pci_bus_addr_in_bar() while it is programming the DMA engine
to deal with case (c).
