Hi Alexandra,

Yes there is. Considering scenario:

tcp_v4_rcv(skb)

/* req sock */
reqsk = _inet_lookup_skb(skb)

/* listen sock */
sk = reqsk(reqsk)->rsk_listener;
sock_hold(sk);
tcp_check_req(sk)


 ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† smc_release /* release 
smc listen sock */
 ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† __smc_release
smc_close_active()¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬† /*¬† smc_sk->sk_state = SMC_CLOSED; */
 ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† if 
(smc_sk->sk_state == SMC_CLOSED)
smc_clcsock_release();
sock_release(clcsk);¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† /* close clcsock */
 ¬†¬†¬† sock_put(sk);¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬† /* might not¬† the final refcnt */

sock_put(smc_sk)¬†¬†¬† /* might be the final refcnt of smc_sock¬† */

syn_recv_sock(sk...)
/* might be the final refcnt of tcp listen sock */
sock_put(sk);

Fortunately, this scenario only affects smc_syn_recv_sock and 
smc_hs_congested, as other callbacks already have locks to protect smc,
which can guarantee that the sk_user_data is either NULL (set in 
smc_close_active) or valid under the lock.

You are right , we need designed it with care, we will try the 
referenced solutions internally first, and I will also send some RFCs so 
that everyone can track the latest progress
and make it can be all agreed.

Our pleasure üòÅ.¬† The stability of smc is important to us too.

Best wishes,
