We are talking about two different access patterns for this device
memory (DM). One is to use this device memory (DM) and second to configure/limit.
Usually those actions will be performed by different groups.

First group (programmers) is using special API [1] through libibverbs [2]
without any notion of cgroups or any limitations. Second group (sysadmins)
is less interested in application specifics and for them "device memory" means
"memory" and not "rdma, nic specific, internal memory".
