The new API seems fit pretty good to our purpose, better than scatter-gather dma-mapping. So we want to continue work with you to adopt this new API.

Sounds great, thanks for the feedback.

This version was tested in our regression tests, but there is a chance
that you are hitting flows that were not relevant for RDMA case.

RFC was fully tested in VFIO and RDMA paths, but not NVMe patch.

> Do you have refined version for us to try? I ask because we are seeing some issues but not sure whether it is caused by the new API. We are debugging but it would be good to also ask at the same time.

Yes, as an outcome of the feedback in this thread, I implemented a new
version. Unfortunately, there are some personal matters that are preventing
from me to send it right away.
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/leon/linux-rdma.git/log/?h=dma-split-v1

There are some differences in the API, but the main idea is the same.
This version is not fully tested yet.

Thanks
