To watch for performance regressions and improvements, I regularly run =
several
variations of iozone, fio 70/30 mix, and multi-threaded software builds. =
I did
not note any change in throughput after applying these patches.

I'm unsure how to measure context switch rate precisely during these =
tests.

This is typical for fio 8KB random 70/30 mix on FDR Infiniband on a NUMA =
client.
Not impressive compared to NVMe, I know, but much better than NFS/TCP. =
On a
single socket client, the IOPS numbers more than double.
