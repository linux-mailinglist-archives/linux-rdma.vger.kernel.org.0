From what I can tell, the missing piece is what happens after .move_notify()
is called. According to the documentation, the exporter remains valid, and
the importer is expected to recreate all mappings.

include/linux/dma-buf.h:
  471          * Mappings stay valid and are not directly affected by this callback.
  472          * But the DMA-buf can now be in a different physical location, so all
  473          * mappings should be destroyed and re-created as soon as possible.
  474          *
  475          * New mappings can be created after this callback returns, and will
  476          * point to the new location of the DMA-buf.

Call to dma_buf_move_notify() does not prevent new attachments to that
exporter, while "revoke" does. In the current code, the importer is not aware
that the exporter no longer exists and will continue calling
dma_buf_map_attachment().

In summary, the current implementation allows a single .attach() check but
permits multiple .map_dma_buf() calls. With "revoke", we gain the ability to
block any subsequent .map_dma_buf() operations.

Main use case is VFIO as exporter and IOMMUFD as importer.
