This is expected. 4791 is the RoCEv2 protocol destination port, and
it's a constant for all RoCEv2 connections. think of it like a tunnel,
similar to VxLAN.

RoCEv2 then applies its own mapping to demultiplex incoming packets to
the proper queue pair. This is based on the RDMA CM connection service
id's. These are based on the upper layer's requested port.

In other words, you need to apply tracing at the proper layer. Wire
level traces aren't going to be very useful.

Btw, iWARP connections won't remap ports like this. But IB and RoCE
will, since they don't natively have an actual 5-tuple defined.
