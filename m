The problem I am trying to solve is that when a destroy verb is called I want
to stop looking up rdma objects from their numbers (rkey, qpn, etc.) which
happens when a new packet arrives that refers to the object. So we start the
object destroy flow but we may hit a long delay if there are already
references taken on the object. In the next patch we are going to add a complete
wait_for_completion so that we won't return to rdma_core until all the refs
are dropped. While we are waiting for some past event to complete and drop its
reference new packets may arrive and take a reference on the object while looking it
up. Potentially this could happen many times. I just want to stop accepting any
new packets as soon as the destroy verb gets called. Meanwhile we will allow
past packets to complete. That is what hide() does.

Show() deals with the opposite problem. The way the object library worked as soon as
the object was created or 'added to the pool' it becomes searchable. But some of the
verbs have a lot of code to execute after the object gets its number assigned so by
setting the link to NULL in the xa_alloc call we get the index assigned but the
object is not searchable. show turns it on at the end for the create verb call after
all the init code is done.

There are likely better names but these were the ones that came to mind.

This works just fine. You are correct for normal xarrays but for allocating xarrays
setting the link to NULL is treated differently and it remembers. Here is the comment
in <kernel>/Documentation

Allocating XArrays

If you use DEFINE_XARRAY_ALLOC() to define the XArray, or initialise it by passing XA_FLAGS_ALLOC to xa_init_flags(), the XArray changes to track whether entries are in use or not.

You can call xa_alloc() to store the entry at an unused index in the XArray. If you need to modify the array from interrupt context, you can use xa_alloc_bh() or xa_alloc_irq() to disable interrupts while allocating the ID.

Using xa_store(), xa_cmpxchg() or xa_insert() will also mark the entry as being allocated. Unlike a normal XArray, storing NULL will mark the entry as being in use, like xa_reserve(). To free an entry, use xa_erase() (or xa_release() if you only want to free the entry if itâ€™s NULL).

This particular example is pretty light weight since rxe_qp_chk_destroy only makes one
memory reference. But dereg_mr actually can do a lot of work and in either case
the idea as explained above is not to wreck the object but prevent rxe_pool_get_index(pool, index)
from succeeding and taking a new ref on the object. Once the verbs client has called a destroy
verb I don't see any reason why we should continue to process newly arriving packets forever which
is the only place in the driver where we convert object numbers to objects.

There is another issue which is not being dealt with here and that is partially torn down
objects. After this patch the flow for a destroy verb for an indexed object is

hide() =	"disable new lookups, e.g. xa_store(NULL)"
		"misc tear down code"
rxe_put() = 	"drop a reference, will be last one if the object is quiescent"
		"if necessary wait until last ref dropped"
		"object cleanup code, includes xa_erase()"

If objects are still holding references you have to be careful to make sure that
nothing in misc tear down code matters for an outstanding reference. Currently this all works
but if any change breaks things we have had to defer the change to the cleanup phase.
It doesn't work by design but just debugging in the past.
