For a client it would definitely not be out of the question, but the main nfs server I cannot easily downgrade.

1.
We have local_length_error counter, it can help to run it on server and clients.
[leonro@vm ~]$ cat /sys/class/infiniband/ibp0s9/ports/1/hw_counters/resp_local_length_error
0

resp_local_length_error - "Number of times responder detected local length errors."
2.
LOC_LEN_ERR supports that is written in CQE error on the client.
This is what is written in our HW document:
 IB compliant completion with error syndrome
	0x1: Local_Length_Error
3.
From IBTA, 11.6.2 COMPLETION RETURN STATUS
Local Length Error - Generated for a Work Request posted to the local
Send Queue when the sum of the Data Segment lengths exceeds the message
length for the channel adapter port. Generated for a Work Request posted
to the local Receive Queue when the sum of the Data Segment lengths is
too small to receive a valid incoming message or the length of the incoming
message is greater than the maximum message size supported by the HCA port
that received the message.


So if "1" works :), we will be able to distinguish if client sends too
large WR or recieves too large.

Thanks
