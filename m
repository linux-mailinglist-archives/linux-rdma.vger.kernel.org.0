The latter. Currently the client has no way to detect that our server
does not comply with RFC 8166, which places no arbitrary limits on
the number of chunks per RPC.

If a client attempts to send more than one chunk the RPC fails (or
worse). RPC/RDMA version 1 does not provide a way to indicate that
the failure was because the client sent too many chunks, so the
client has to terminate the RPC transaction with an error.
