Even with direct mappings only we still need to take care of
cache synchronization.

The DMA API callers really need to know what is P2P or not for
various reasons.  And they should generally have that information
available, either from pin_user_pages that needs to special case
it or from the in-kernel I/O submitter that build it from P2P and
normal memory.

Again, your callers must know what is a P2P region and what is not.
I don't think it is a hard burdern to do mappings at that granularity,
and we can encapsulate this in nice helpes for say the block layer
and pin_user_pages callers to start.

That is in general a function of the upper layer and not the DMA code.

And this step is only needed for the iommu case.

dma_get_merge_boundary already provides this information in terms
of the device capabilities.  And given that the callers knows what
is P2P and what is not we have all the information that is needed.
