It does not decrease the performance from current cpu_local_spread(),
but optimum performance comes when node has CPUs double that of number
of IRQs (considering SMT==2). 

Now only if the number of CPUs are same that of number of IRQs,
(that is num of CPUs <= 64) then, we see same performance like existing
design with cpu_local_spread().

If node has more CPUs than 64, then we get better performance than 
cpu_local_spread().

I will share a chart on next version of patch 3.
